veridex_check 测试结果 
=============veridex[android13-release] 检测结果==============
NOTE: appcompat.sh is still under development. It can report
API uses that do not execute at runtime, and reflection uses
that do not exist. It can also miss on reflection uses.
#1: Reflection unsupported Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;->accessFlags use(s):
       Lcom/analysys/track/utils/reflectinon/ClazzUtils;->getFieldAccessFlags(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;
       Lcom/analysys/track/utils/reflectinon/ClazzUtils;->unFinal(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)V

1 hidden API(s) used: 0 linked against, 1 through reflection
	1 in unsupported
	0 in blocked
	0 in max-target-o
	0 in max-target-p
	0 in max-target-q
	0 in max-target-r
To run an analysis that can give more reflection accesses, 
but could include false positives, pass the --imprecise flag.
